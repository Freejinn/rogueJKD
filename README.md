This is my attempt at making Jack's website better.
I have connected several html pages.
I use a bit of JavaScript to run an auto slide show on the home page
and to create a sign up module that appears once a button is clicked.
I have been adding styles to a very LONG css file. It is really like a big wad of gum
that I keep adding pieces to. Not sure if it looks how it should look.
Any feedback appreciated.
