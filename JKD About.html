                <p><b>Our instructors</b> train instensively and have passed curriculum test in order to earn their rank.
                    Cheif instructor Jack has worked as a professional in both clinical psychology and university education.
                    He has passed yearly FBI background screenings for two decades as a counselor, university instructor, and 
                    coach through the governing body for olympic boxing. He is a parent, as are most of our instructors, and 
                    understands that you need your children in a safe enviornment.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Our students</b> learn all four empty had ranges (kicking, punching, trapping-clinch and grappling) and all five 
                    ranges of weapons. In addition,  they learn self-control, respect, and discipline in a supportive and inclusive environment.

                            Many martial arts schools can teach you MMA, JKD, and Filipino arts, but at Rogue you will have the benefit of 
                            learning under an instructor who worked as a professional teacher and a professional in preventing and neutralizing 
                            actual violence and crisis.

                            Law enforcement personnel (Navy seals, police and FBI swat) have relied 
                            on us for their training.

                            We teach EMOTIONAL CONTENT. Our goal is to make sure that YOU can make your skills work when you need them. Here, we will give 
                            you more than information and more than some moves. You will learn an actual skillset like an MMA fighter 
                            who has adapted their skills for protection. This includes instruction on how to manage fear and anger, so your 
                            emotions do not undermine your decisions, judgments, and actions.

                            Rogue's vision endeavors to honor the principles, multiculturalism, and attitudes that Bruce Lee (and all the other gifted instructors 
                            who have taught us) held dear. These are: <span class="emphasis">functionality, competence, independence, authenticity, awareness, freedom, creativity, and self-expression.</span>
